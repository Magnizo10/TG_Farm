TGfarm is a structured SQL Server relational database designed to support the operations of an agricultural or cooperative farm. The system aims to streamline data management related to suppliers, supplier transactions, farmers, employees, farming equipment, and crop cultivation.

This database provides a foundational backend that can be integrated with farm management software, mobile apps, or analytical dashboards to help with:

Tracking supplier deliveries and purchases

Managing farmer and employee records

Monitoring equipment assets

Logging crop types and planting schedules

The schema emphasizes referential integrity through foreign key constraints and includes real-world entities like suppliertransactions, crop_planted, and equipment.
